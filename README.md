# üîó Store

This is the source of the `Store` of Caido.
If you are only consuming the `Store`, this repository is not for you. You can find all extensions already in Caido.

> WARNING: We do not endorse the plugins in the store. We do our best to conduct due diligence to ensure they are safe, but you use them at your own risk.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How does it work?

At a regular interval, our cloud service will look at the `plugin_packages.json` file for all the plugins that exist in the store.

This list will then be queried by the Caido Instances to display them in the `Store` page.

## ü§î How do I make my plugin available?

For your plugin to be listed in the store you MUST follow the [steps outlined in our documentation](https://developer.caido.io/guides/distribution/store.html).
